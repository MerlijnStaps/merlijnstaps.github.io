## About me
{%endif%}

{%if page.excerpt == nil %}
Welcome to my website!{%endif%}

My name is Merlijn. I am a PhD student with [Corina Tarnita][corina]{:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology][eeb]{:target="_blank"} at Princeton University. 
I am broadly interested in the origins and evolution of self-organizing complex systems in biology, such as multicellular organisms and social insect colonies.

### Research interests

Trained as a pure mathematician (and developmental biologist), in my work I try to understand the origins and evolution of biological complexity through **simple theoretical models**. 
I try to leverage the simplicity of these models to generalize across empirical systems and &#8212; hopefully &#8212; identify fundamental principles of biological organization. 

Fascinated by the complexities of multicellular development &#8212; the self-organizing process by which multicellular bodies are constructed, starting from just a single cell &#8212; my current work is aimed at understanding
the **evolutionary origins of multicellular developmental programs**. Thus, I try to understand how nascent multicellular organisms might have evolved the organizing principles
required for multicellular development, including growth and reproduction, cell differentiation, and spatial patterning.

### Teaching

In addition to doing research, I love to teach. Read more about my teaching <a href="/teaching/">here</a>.
