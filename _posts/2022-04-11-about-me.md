## About me
{%endif%}

{%if page.excerpt == nil %}
Welcome to my website!{%endif%}

My name is Merlijn. I am a PhD student with [Corina Tarnita][corina]{:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology][eeb]{:target="_blank"} at Princeton University. 
I use mathematical methods to study problems in evolutionary biology.

### Research interests

Much of my work is aimed at understanding the origins and evolution of complexity in biological systems. 
For example, how did the developmental programs of multicellular organisms first evolve?

I use **simple theoretical models** to address such questions. By virtue of their simplicity, these models are well-suited to generalize across empirical systems and reveal fundamental principles of biological organization. 



### Teaching

In addition to doing research, I love to teach. Read more about my teaching <a href="/teaching/">here</a>.
