Welcome to my website!{%endif%}

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology][eeb]{:target="_blank"} at Princeton University. My advisor is [Corina Tarnita][corina]{:target="_blank"}.

I am a mathematical biologist broadly interested in questions at the interface of development and evolution.

My approach to study these questions typically relies at least in part on simple theoretical models. 
By virtue of their simplicity, these models are well-suited to generalize across empirical systems and reveal general biological principles. 

#### Theme 1: Emergence of development at the origins of multicellularity

Multicellular development -- the process by which multicellular organization arises, typically starting from just a single cell -- is a miracle of self-organization. 
Multicellular development is also a product of evolution. However, we know very little about how multicellular development originated in evolution. In my work, I use models to attempt to understand how 
principles of multicellular development could have emerged at or around the origins of multicellularity. In doing so, I take advantage of recent empirical insights that have 
revolutionized our understanding of the first multicellular organisms and their unicellular ancestors.

#### Theme 2: Developmental strategies and environmental variability

No organism faces a completely stable environment. As a result, many organisms have evolved developmental strategies that allow them to respond flexibly to their surroundings. 
However, such strategies are far from universal. In fact, a hallmark of multicellular development that it is generally highly robust in the face of environmental variability. 
Theoretically, it remains poorly understood how the ways in which organisms dynamically respond (or not) to variation in their surroundings are shaped by selection.
I explore this question in the context of task allocation in collective systems (e.g., multicellular organisms, social insect colonies): when should such systems flexibly adjust the number of individuals allocated 
to various tasks to their environment?


#### Theme 3: The role of development in shaping evolution

Development is a product of evolution, but, in turn, evolution may be shaped by development. Indeed, what types of (changes in) phenotypic organization are possible over evolutionary time 
depends on the underlying developmental processes. Understanding how development shapes evolution requires an integrative approach that combines develomental insights with evolutionary analyses.
In my work, I take such an approach using color patterns, which are easily-observed and strikingly diverse phenotypes whose development is increasingly understood.
