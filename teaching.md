## Teaching

I find teaching one of the most rewarding aspects of my work. Most of my past teaching experience is in **mathematical biology** and **statistics**, topics that I really enjoy teaching 
because they are beautiful in their own right and also serve themselves well to help students develop the ability to think critically, rigorously, and quantitatively. 

### Past teaching experience (Princeton)

At Princeton (2018-), I was an assistant in instruction for four undergraduate courses in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology department:

* 2021: EEB325, Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine
* 2020: EEB325, Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine
* 2019: EEB380, Ecology and Conservation of African Landscapes
* 2018: EEB311, Animal Behavior

In 2022, I was <A HREF="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/05/13/graduate-students-honored-excellence-teaching" TARGET="_BLANK">recognized</A> with a Graduate Teaching Award for my teaching at Princeton.

From 2022, I also served as <A HREF="https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/about/meet-our-staff/graduate-teaching-fellows" TARGET="_BLANK">Graduate Teaching Fellow</A>, a role which involves training first-time 
graduate assistants in instruction. 

In 2022, I co-taught a community-level course in human biology to incarcerated students through the <A HREF="https://prisonteaching.org/" TARGET="_BLANK">Prison Teaching Initiative</A>.

### Past teaching experience (Utrecht)

At Utrecht (2011-2018), I was a teaching assistant for various undergraduate courses in the mathematics and biology departments:

* 2017: Introduction to geometry
* 2016: Group theory
* 2016: Mathematical statistics
* 2015: Measure and integration
* 2014: Experiment and statistics
* 2014: Mathematical statistics
* 2013: Applied biostatistics
* 2013: Systems biology

### Other teaching

From 2012-2019, I was a coach in the <A HREF="https://www.wiskundeolympiade.nl" TARGET="_BLANK">Dutch Mathematical Olympiad</A> program.
