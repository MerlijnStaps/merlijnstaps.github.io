## Teaching

I find teaching one of the most rewarding aspects of my work. I mostly enjoy teaching mathematical biology and statistics, 
because they are beautiful topics in their own right and also lend themselves well to help biology students develop the ability to think critically, rigorously, and quantitatively. 

### Current teaching (Princeton)

As a lecturer in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department, I designed the new course EEB355, Statistics for Biologists, and teach it in Spring 2024 and Spring 2025. See the advertisement for the first iteration of the course below:

In Fall 2024, I also teach EEB325, Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine.

### Past teaching experience (Princeton)

As a graduate student at Princeton (2018-2023), I was an assistant in instruction for four undergraduate courses in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology department:

* 2021: EEB325, Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine
* 2020: EEB325, Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine
* 2019: EEB380, Ecology and Conservation of African Landscapes
* 2018: EEB311, Animal Behavior

In 2022, I was recognized with a <A HREF="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/05/13/graduate-students-honored-excellence-teaching" TARGET="_BLANK">Graduate Teaching Award</A> for my teaching at Princeton.

From 2022, I also served as <A HREF="https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/about/meet-our-staff/graduate-teaching-fellows" TARGET="_BLANK">Graduate Teaching Fellow</A>, a role which involves training first-time 
graduate assistants in instruction. 

In 2022, I co-taught a community-level course in human biology to incarcerated students through the <A HREF="https://prisonteaching.org/" TARGET="_BLANK">Prison Teaching Initiative</A>.

### Past teaching experience (Utrecht)

At Utrecht (2011-2018), I was a teaching assistant for various undergraduate courses in the mathematics and biology departments:

* 2017: Introduction to geometry
* 2016: Group theory
* 2016: Mathematical statistics
* 2015: Measure and integration
* 2014: Experiment and statistics
* 2014: Mathematical statistics
* 2013: Applied biostatistics
* 2013: Systems biology

### Other teaching

From 2012-2019, I was a coach in the <A HREF="https://www.wiskundeolympiade.nl" TARGET="_BLANK">Dutch Mathematical Olympiad</A> program.
