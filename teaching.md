## Teaching


For me, teaching is one of the most rewarding aspects of my work. Most of my past teaching experience is in courses about **mathematical biology** and **statistics**, topics that I really enjoy to teach 
because they are beautiful in their own right and also serve themselves well to help students develop the ability to think critically, rigorously, and quantitatively. 

In 2022, I was <A HREF="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/05/13/graduate-students-honored-excellence-teaching" TARGET="_BLANK">recognized</A> with a Graduate Teaching Award for my teaching at Princeton.

### Past teaching experience

At Princeton (2018-2021), I was an Assistant in Instruction for the undergraduate courses *Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine* (2x),
*Ecology and Conservation of African Landscapes*, and 
*Animal Behavior*. I also designed and led a statistics refresher for EEB undergraduates.

At Utrecht (2011-2018), I was a teaching assistant for various undergraduate courses in the mathematics and biology departments.

From 2012-2019, I was a coach in the <A HREF="https://www.wiskundeolympiade.nl" TARGET="_BLANK">Dutch Mathematical Olympiad</A> program.
