## Teaching


Teaching is, for me, one of the most rewarding aspects of being in academia. Most of my past teaching experience is in courses about **mathematical biology** and **statistics**, topics that I really enjoy to teach 
because they are beautiful in their own right and also serve themselves well to help students develop the ability to think critically, rigorously, and quantitatively. 

### Teaching at Princeton

Courses for which I was an Assistant and Instruction (TA) at Princeton:

- EEB325, *Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine* (Fall 2021) 
- EEB325, *Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine* (Fall 2020) 
- EEB380, *Ecology and Conservation of African Landscapes* (Spring 2019) 
- EEB311, *Animal Behavior* (Fall 2018) 

In Fall 2021, I also designed and led the statistics refresher for EEB undergraduates.

### Past teaching experience

When studying at Utrecht (2011-2018), I was a teaching assistent for numerous courses, including <I>Systems Biology</I>, <I>Experimental design and Statistics</I>, and *Applied biostatistics* (biology department), and 
*Introduction to Geometry*, *Group Theory*, *Measure Theory*, and *Mathematical statistics* (math department).

From 2012-2019, I was a trainer in the <A HREF="https://www.wiskundeolympiade.nl" TARGET="_BLANK">Dutch Mathematical Olympiad</A> program. As a trainer, I was involved in selecting and preparing talented high school students for international mathematics competitions, 
most notably the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This work included designing materials, organizing and teaching training activities, and tutoring students.
